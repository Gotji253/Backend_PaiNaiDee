# This file makes 'app' a Python package.
# You can leave it empty or add package-level imports here if desired.

# Example: Expose main app object if structured differently, but usually not needed for FastAPI structure.
# from .main import app

# Example: Make settings easily accessible (though direct import from core.config is common)
# from .core.config import settings
